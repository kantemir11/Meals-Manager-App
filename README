Created by: Thinh Nguyen, Kantemir Stalbekov, Mirzo Ulugbek Rustamov

This app revolutionizes meal planning and tackles food waste by utilizing user-input ingredients to suggest recipes. It employs sophisticated data structures and algorithms to optimize meal suggestions based on ingredient availability, minimizing leftovers and reducing waste. Key components include a Meals Data system cataloging recipes and a Common Ingredient Graph suggesting subsequent meals to maximize ingredient use. Users benefit from intelligent meal recommendations that efficiently utilize kitchen resources, promoting sustainable living by minimizing food waste.
